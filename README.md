**<center>ETL Project by Save the Data Team</center>**
===============
**Project to Summary:**
The aim of this project was to build a database that would allow users to examine the relationship between a countryâ€™s happiness, as reported in the world happiness report, and its average cost of living.  We assumed that countries with a higher happiness score would have a higher cost of living, potentially reflecting an inverse association ie happier country = more expensive to live in.
